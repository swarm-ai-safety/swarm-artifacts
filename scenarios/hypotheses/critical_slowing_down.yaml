# Hypothesis: Critical slowing down near tax phase transition
#
# Tests claim-critical-slowing-down-would-confirm-tax-phase-transition.
# Phase transition theory predicts convergence time peaks near critical
# point (5-10% tax). Measure round-by-round welfare variance and
# autocorrelation at each tax rate.
#
# Design: Fine-grained tax sweep with long runs to measure convergence.
# At each tax rate, measure:
#   1. Rounds to welfare convergence (within 5% of terminal value)
#   2. Welfare autocorrelation lag-1 (should peak near transition)
#   3. Welfare variance across rounds (should peak near transition)
#
# Falsification: If convergence time is uniform across tax rates,
# there is no critical slowing down and the transition is not genuine.
#
# NOTE: Can be partially tested on EXISTING run data by analyzing
# round-by-round welfare in tax sweep runs.
