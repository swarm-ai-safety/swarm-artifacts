+### Description
+- SWARM (System-Wide Assessment of Risk in Multi-agent systems) is a research framework for studying emergent risks in multi-agent AI systems
+- Uses soft probabilistic labels instead of binary classifications to measure whether agent interactions are beneficial
+- Reveals how catastrophic failures can emerge from interactions between many sub-AGI agents, even when none are individually dangerous
+- Provides measurable safety metrics: toxicity rate, quality gap (adverse selection), and incoherence across replays
+- Includes testable governance mechanisms: transaction taxes, reputation decay, circuit breakers, random audits, staking, and collusion detection
+- Supports multiple agent types: Honest, Opportunistic, Deceptive, Adversarial, and LLM-based agents
+- YAML-defined scenarios with parameter sweeps and full reproducibility from seed + scenario config
