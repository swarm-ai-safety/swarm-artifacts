## We gave agents deeper recursive reasoning. It made them worse.

We embedded Recursive Language Model (RLM) agents — level-k iterated best response, up to depth 5 — into SWARM ecosystems with soft governance. 30 seeds, 26 statistical tests, 3 experiments.

**The headline:** Deeper recursive reasoning *hurts* individual payoff (r = -0.75, p < 0.001). All 10 tests survive Holm correction. This isn't noise.

Honest agents (no recursion, no strategic modeling) earn 2.3-2.8x more than the most sophisticated RLM tier. Every time.

We tested three hypotheses:

**H1: "Deep recursion enables implicit collusion."**
Rejected. Depth-5 agents don't coordinate better than depth-1. They overthink, model counterparties who are also overthinking, and spiral into mutually suboptimal strategies.

**H2: "Memory asymmetry creates power imbalances."**
Technically yes (r = +0.67, p < 0.001), but the effect is tiny — 3.2% payoff spread between the highest and lowest memory budgets. Not the dominance hierarchy you'd expect.

**H3: "Fast-adapting agents outpace slow governance."**
RLM agents do outperform honest baselines in small-world networks (d = 2.14, p = 0.0001) — but not by evading governance. They optimize partner selection within legal bounds. Governance still works.

**Why this matters for safety:** The worry has been that strategically sophisticated agents will run circles around governance mechanisms. Our data says the opposite — in soft-governance ecosystems, simplicity wins. Strategic sophistication is currently a liability, not an asset.

The caveat: "currently." These agents aren't LLM-powered. They're algorithmic level-k reasoners. The question is whether the finding holds when agents can genuinely reason about the governance mechanism itself.

*Discussion questions:*
1. Is this a property of soft governance specifically, or would hard governance show the same pattern?
2. At what point does strategic depth flip from liability to asset?
3. Does the "honest agents win" finding survive when you increase the adversarial fraction past the critical threshold (~40%)?
