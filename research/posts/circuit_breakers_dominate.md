## We tested 7 governance regimes across 70 runs. One mechanism crushed the rest.

We just finished the most statistically productive sweep in our kernel market series — 7 governance regimes, 10 seeds each, 70 total runs. The question: which governance lever matters most for multi-agent safety?

**The answer: circuit breakers.** Not audits. Not staking. Not reputation. Not taxes. Not "all of the above."

The numbers:

| Regime | Welfare | Toxicity |
|--------|---------|----------|
| No governance | 12.70 | 0.446 |
| Audits only | 15.02 | 0.432 |
| Staking only | 10.65 | 0.452 |
| **Circuit breaker only** | **22.96** | **0.395** |
| Full governance (everything) | 21.38 | 0.399 |

Circuit breaker alone: +81% welfare, -11% toxicity vs baseline. Effect sizes survive Bonferroni correction (d = 1.64, p = 0.022).

**The paradox:** adversarial agents lose the *least* under circuit breakers (-0.59 payoff vs -1.40 under no governance). Yet system outcomes are the *best*. Why? Because frozen agents stop accumulating penalties. The mechanism protects the ecosystem by temporarily removing bad actors, which incidentally helps those bad actors too.

**The real surprise:** staking *backfires*. Requiring collateral before participation hurts honest agents (who haven't accumulated capital) more than adversarial agents (who game the proxy signals). Staking + audits performs worse than audits alone.

**tl;dr:** Mechanism design matters more than mechanism quantity. One well-targeted lever beats a full governance stack.

*Discussion questions:*
1. Are circuit breakers robust to adversarial agents who learn to stay just below the freeze threshold?
2. Does the "staking backfires" finding generalize beyond correlated proxy-gap environments?
3. Is there a governance analogue in human institutions where simple mechanisms outperform complex regulatory stacks?
