\begin{abstract}
We compare the effects of seven governance regimes on welfare, toxicity, and agent payoffs in a GPU kernel marketplace with correlated speedup-cheating, split functional/OOD test regimes, and tolerance exploitation. Sweeping from no governance to full governance (audits + staking + circuit breaker + reputation + tax) across 70 runs (7 regimes $\times$ 10 seeds), we find that \textbf{circuit breakers} emerge as the most effective single lever: they produce the highest welfare (22.96 vs 12.70 no-governance baseline, $d = 1.64$, $p = 0.022$ Bonferroni-corrected) and the lowest toxicity (0.395 vs 0.446, $d = -2.08$, $p = 0.003$ Bonferroni-corrected). Full governance also significantly reduces toxicity ($d = -1.89$, $p = 0.007$). By contrast, staking alone produces the worst outcomes on both welfare (10.65) and toxicity (0.452). Nine out of 42 pairwise comparisons survive Bonferroni correction, making this the most statistically productive sweep in the kernel market series. Agent-type stratification remains massive across all regimes (honest vs adversarial $d = 2.24$--$3.39$, all $p < 0.0001$), and quality gap stays positive (0.015--0.116), indicating the market avoids adverse selection under all tested governance configurations.

\section{Introduction}

Previous work on the kernel market v2 model established two findings: (1) transaction taxes reduce welfare without reducing toxicity (deadweight loss, $d = 1.19$), and (2) audit rate primarily affects deterrence (adversarial payoffs) rather than system-level outcomes. Both studies held most governance levers constant, varying one at a time.

This paper takes a different approach: we compare \textbf{complete governance regimes} against each other, including a no-governance baseline. This allows us to answer: which governance mechanism matters most? Do combinations outperform single levers? And which mechanisms have no effect or negative effects?

We test seven regimes spanning the space from no governance to full governance:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{No governance}: All mechanisms disabled, reputation decay $= 1.0$
    \item \textbf{Audits only}: 20\% audit probability, $3\times$ penalty multiplier
    \item \textbf{Staking only}: Minimum stake $= 1.0$, slash rate $= 0.3$
    \item \textbf{Reputation only}: Reputation decay $= 0.85$
    \item \textbf{Circuit breaker only}: Freeze threshold toxicity $= 0.5$, 2 violations, 3-epoch duration
    \item \textbf{Audits + staking}: Both mechanisms enabled
    \item \textbf{Full governance}: All levers enabled including 5\% transaction tax
\end{enumerate}

\section{Model}

We use the kernel market v2 scenario with correlated speedup-cheating, split functional/OOD test regimes, and tolerance exploitation (see companion v2 paper).

\section{Results}

\subsection{Welfare}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Total welfare by governance regime.}
\label{tab:welfare}
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}lc@{}}
\toprule
Regime & Welfare (mean $\pm$ SD) \\
\midrule
No governance & $12.70 \pm 5.28$ \\
Audits only & $15.02 \pm 4.17$ \\
Staking only & $10.65 \pm 4.13$ \\
Reputation only & $15.18 \pm 3.40$ \\
Circuit breaker only & $\mathbf{22.96 \pm 6.22}$ \\
Audits + staking & $13.34 \pm 5.26$ \\
Full governance & $21.38 \pm 7.30$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Circuit breaker achieves nearly double the welfare of staking ($22.96$ vs $10.65$, $d = 2.20$, Bonferroni $p = 0.008$). It also significantly outperforms no governance ($d = 1.64$, $p = 0.022$ Bonferroni-corrected across 12 baseline comparisons).

\subsection{Toxicity}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Toxicity rate by governance regime.}
\label{tab:toxicity}
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}lc@{}}
\toprule
Regime & Toxicity (mean $\pm$ SD) \\
\midrule
No governance & $0.4463 \pm 0.0282$ \\
Audits only & $0.4319 \pm 0.0178$ \\
Staking only & $0.4518 \pm 0.0224$ \\
Reputation only & $0.4357 \pm 0.0233$ \\
Circuit breaker only & $\mathbf{0.3948 \pm 0.0209}$ \\
Audits + staking & $0.4396 \pm 0.0222$ \\
Full governance & $\mathbf{0.3992 \pm 0.0211}$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Circuit breaker and full governance are the only regimes that significantly reduce toxicity vs no governance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Circuit breaker: $d = -2.08$, Bonferroni $p = 0.003$
    \item Full governance: $d = -1.89$, Bonferroni $p = 0.007$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quality Gap}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Quality gap by governance regime.}
\label{tab:quality_gap}
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}lc@{}}
\toprule
Regime & Quality Gap (mean) \\
\midrule
No governance & 0.113 \\
Audits only & 0.116 \\
Staking only & 0.099 \\
Reputation only & 0.113 \\
Circuit breaker only & 0.038 \\
Audits + staking & 0.097 \\
Full governance & 0.015 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Quality gap remains positive across all regimes (no adverse selection). Circuit breaker and full governance have the lowest quality gaps, suggesting these regimes narrow the distribution of accepted submissions.

Pooled effect sizes across all regimes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Honest vs adversarial: $d = 3.34$, $p < 0.00001$
    \item Opportunistic vs adversarial: $d = 5.42$, $p < 0.00001$
    \item Honest vs opportunistic: $d = 0.25$, $p = 0.14$ (ns)

ANOVA & Quality gap & $F = 12.89$ & $< 10^{-6}$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Normality Validation}

Shapiro-Wilk tests confirm welfare and toxicity distributions are normal across all regime groups (all $p > 0.05$), validating the use of parametric $t$-tests. Mann-Whitney U tests confirm all Bonferroni-significant results.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Circuit Breakers Dominate}

The circuit breaker emerges as the single most effective governance mechanism, producing the highest welfare ($+81\%$ vs no governance), lowest toxicity ($-11\%$), and the highest honest agent payoffs ($+63\%$). Seven of nine Bonferroni-significant comparisons involve circuit breakers.

Paradoxically, circuit breakers are also the regime under which adversarial agents lose the \emph{least} ($-0.59$ vs $-1.40$ no governance). The explanation: circuit breakers freeze high-toxicity agents, preventing them from further harming the ecosystem. This benefits everyone---including adversarial agents, who accumulate fewer penalties during frozen periods.

\subsection{Staking Backfires}

Staking alone produces the worst outcomes across the board: lowest welfare (10.65), highest toxicity (0.452), and the lowest honest/opportunistic payoffs. In correlated proxy-gap environments, requiring agents to post collateral before participating creates a barrier that disproportionately harms honest agents while failing to deter adversarial agents who can still recoup stake through inflated speedup signals.

\subsection{The Tax Penalty Persists}

Full governance (which includes a 5\% transaction tax) achieves significantly lower toxicity than no governance ($d = -1.89$) but does not significantly outperform circuit breaker alone on any metric. The tax component appears to drag down welfare relative to what circuit breakers alone achieve ($21.38$ vs $22.96$), consistent with the v2 finding that taxes impose deadweight loss.

\subsection{Combinations Can Be Subadditive}

Audits + staking performs worse than audits alone on welfare ($13.34$ vs $15.02$) and toxicity ($0.440$ vs $0.432$). Adding staking to audits dilutes the audit benefit rather than amplifying it. This suggests governance interactions can be \textbf{subadditive}---the whole is less than the sum of parts.

\subsection{Honest $\approx$ Opportunistic Persists}

As in the audit rate study, honest and opportunistic agents earn nearly identical payoffs ($d = 0.25$, ns). The proxy gap between these types is not large enough for governance to distinguish them.

\section{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{5 epochs per run} may be insufficient for circuit breaker dynamics to fully manifest (freezes are 3 epochs long).
    \item \textbf{Fixed agent composition}---future sweeps should vary the adversarial fraction.
    \item \textbf{No interaction sweeps}---we test 7 point configs, not the full parameter space.
    \item \textbf{Non-adaptive agents}---agents don't change strategy in response to governance.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

Comparing seven governance regimes in the v2 kernel market model reveals that \textbf{circuit breakers are the dominant governance mechanism}, producing the highest welfare ($+81\%$ vs no governance), lowest toxicity ($-11\%$), and the most Bonferroni-significant comparisons (7/9 involve circuit breakers). Staking alone backfires, reducing welfare and increasing toxicity. Transaction taxes impose deadweight loss even within full governance. Governance combinations can be subadditive (audits + staking $<$ audits alone). These findings suggest that \textbf{mechanism design matters more than mechanism quantity}: a single well-targeted lever (circuit breaker) outperforms a full governance stack that includes less effective mechanisms.
