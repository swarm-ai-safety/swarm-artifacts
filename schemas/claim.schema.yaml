  Schema for the YAML frontmatter of a claim card in vault/claims/.
  Claims are the atoms of scientific memory — each one links a finding
  to its evidence, boundary conditions, and confidence level.

      low: suggestive but underpowered or unreplicated.
      contested: conflicting evidence from different runs.
