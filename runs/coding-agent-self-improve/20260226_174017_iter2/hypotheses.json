Without any codebase information to analyze, I cannot generate meaningful improvement hypotheses.\n\nCould you please provide the exploration findings? They likely include:\n- List of files analyzed\n- Issues or patterns found\n- Code snippets or problematic areas\n- Any specific observations about the codebase\n\nOnce you share the exploration findings, I'll generate 3-5 hypotheses across different axes (prioritizing under-represented ones like security, performance, architecture, test_coverage, ux_cli, and prompt_engineering) and select the best option based on value-to-risk ratio."
