  "raw_summary": "Based on my exploration so far, here's a summary of findings before completing a more comprehensive analysis:\n\n## Key Observations\n\n**CLI (ux_cli) is substantially incomplete**:\n- `cli.py` contains only placeholder print statements about UX features\n- No argument parsing, flags, help text, or functional command-line interface\n- README documents usage patterns that don't match actual code\n\n**Architecture shows specialized sub-agent system**:\n- Multiple types: explorer (read-only), test_runner (read+bash), coder (full tools)\n- Each has scoped tool access via `EXPLORER_TOOLS`, `TEST_TOOLS`, `CODER_TOOLS`\n- Context budgets and turn limits are enforced per sub-agent\n\n**Observability already implemented**:\n- `debug.py` provides structured logging (`debug_log`, `debug_request`, `debug_response`, `debug_timer`)\n- Usage visible in stderr/stdout via ANSI color codes\n\n**Tool implementations appear solid**:\n- Safety measures: sensitive file detection, binary file warnings, 10MB file limits\n- Bash commands restricted to safe list with user confirmation for dangerous ones\n- Output truncation at 30K characters\n\n**Performance mechanisms**:\n- Context auto-compact when approaching token limits (via `context.py`)\n- Sub-agents forced to summarize when budgets exhausted\n\n**Test coverage exists**:\n- 17 test files covering tools, sessions, safety, streaming, authentication\n\nThe cli.py being completely non-functional stands out as the most immediate deficiency. The sub-agent tool-scoping pattern and context management suggest there may be architectural improvements for clearer abstractions or better performance when delegating tasks."
