  "raw_summary": "It appears that `./tests` does not exist as a directory, which means there are no test-related files to modify for enhancing test coverage. Given this and our exploration findings, let's generate hypotheses across different axes:\n\n1. **Observability: Logging and Metrics Integration**\n   - Description: Enhance logging levels within `debug.py`. Introduce structured JSON logging with metrics collection during session execution, such as tracking API latency, token usages, and other performance characteristics.\n   - Files to Change: `debug.py`, potentially `.github/workflows/**/*.yml`\n   - Estimated Value: 8\n   - Estimated Risk: 3\n   - Net Score: 5\n\n2. **UX CLI Enhancements**\n   - Description: Improve the command-line interaction by ensuring more informative help messages, clearer error handling, and adding progress feedback for lengthy commands.\n   - Files to Change: `cli.py` (or similar entry point files if they exist)\n   - Estimated Value: 7\n   - Estimated Risk: 4\n   - Net Score: 3\n\n3. **Architecture Refactoring**\n   - Description: Extract shared utilities such as logging, configuration management into a dedicated module to improve maintainability and modularity of the codebase.\n   - Files to Change: `common/utils.py`\n   - Estimated Value: 6\n   - Estimated Risk: 2\n   - Net Score: 4\n\nGiven that observability is an under-represented axis with high potential value, here's a selected hypothesis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hypotheses\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"H1\",\n      \"title\": \"Add structured JSON logging and metrics collection to enhance observability.\",\n      \"axis\": \"observability\",\n      \"description\": \"Enable structured JSON logging in session execution for improved tracking.
