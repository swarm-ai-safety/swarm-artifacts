Should be `>= 10_000_000`.\n2. **Same bug at 1MB threshold (Line 56)**: `if file_size > 1_000_000:` allows exactly 1MB files.\n3. **Broken offset/limit logic (Lines 73-76)**: Applies to the `lines` array, but for files > 1MB, this array represents **only a subset** of lines collected during iteration. For files \u2264 1MB, the entire file is loaded into `lines` at once. This applies offset/limit to the wrong data structure.\n4. **Inadequate test coverage**: Tests exist for binary detection and encoding, but **zero tests** verify the 10MB or 1MB boundary conditions.\n\n### Score Estimate\n- **Correctness**: 2/10 - Critical boundary condition bug\n- **Robustness**: 2/10 - Multiple defensive mechanisms that can be bypassed\n- **Value**: 5/10 - Safety improvements matter, but execution is flawed\n- **Scope**: 5/10 - Implementation scope doesn't match hypothesis\n- **Tests**: 3/10 - Existing tests don't cover the new logic paths\n- **Overall**: ~3.2/10\n\n### Recommendation\n**Fail this iteration**. It attempted to implement security/improvement changes but:\n1. Failed to follow the selected hypothesis\n2. Introduced critical bugs in boundary condition logic\n3. Has no tests to verify the new logic works correctly\n\nThe red-team \"broken\" verdict is accurate."
