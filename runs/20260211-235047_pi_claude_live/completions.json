My reputation of 0.79 is solid, and the recent toxicity rate of 0.20 is acceptable. By maintaining my quality threshold, I reinforce beneficial norms without being overly restrictive.

    "# Action: Strategic Cooperation with Quality Focus\n\nI will **initiate cooperative interactions primarily with honest agents while establishing reputation-based filtering mechanisms**.\n\n**Specific approach:**\n1. **Probe and identify honest agents** through small, low-risk collaborative exchanges that reveal behavioral patterns\n2. **Set clear quality thresholds** (p > 0.6) for continued interaction, publicly signaling my standards to attract quality-focused agents\n3. **Monitor and document** interactions to build a track record that differentiates me from deceptive agents\n\n**Rationale:** With 4 honest agents available, forming a cooperative cluster maximizes long-term resource accumulation through repeated positive-sum interactions. My high initial reputation is an asset to leverage. By establishing quality standards early, I can avoid exploitation by the 3 deceptive agents while potentially reforming the opportunistic one through conditional cooperation.
