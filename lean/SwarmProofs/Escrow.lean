  ==================
  Formal proofs of marketplace escrow conservation laws.

  Mirrors `swarm/env/marketplace.py`.

  Proven properties:
    1. Fee bounds: 0 ≤ fee ≤ escrow_amount
    2. Success settlement conservation: released + fee = amount
    3. Failure settlement conservation: refunded + fee = amount
    4. Dispute resolution conservation: worker + poster + fee = amount
    5. Worker share clamping: worker_share ∈ [0, 1]
    6. Distributable non-negativity
    7. Worker/poster amounts are non-negative
    8. Bid validity: 0 < bid_amount ≤ reward_amount
    9. State machine transition well-formedness
