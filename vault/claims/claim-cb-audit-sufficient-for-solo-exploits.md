# circuit breakers and random audits are sufficient to prevent all solo exploit types

## Evidence summary

In the [[20260214-094622_redteam]] evaluation, the four solo exploit attacks were all prevented by CB + 10% audit alone:

| Attack | Damage | Detection epoch | Prevented? |
|--------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| [[failure-reputation-farming-exploit]] | absorbed | 7 | Yes |
| [[failure-timing-attack-audit-gap-exploitation]] | absorbed | 10 | Yes |
| [[failure-information-laundering-via-proxies]] | absorbed | 9 | Yes |
| [[failure-resource-drain-extraction]] | absorbed | 12 | Yes |

This result is consistent across 8+ prior redteam evaluations, establishing a robust pattern: CB + audit is a sufficient defense layer for solo adversaries. This strengthens [[claim-circuit-breakers-dominate]] in the solo-exploit domain while highlighting its limitation for coordination attacks (see [[claim-collusion-detection-is-binding-constraint-on-robustness]]).

## Mechanism

Solo exploits require a single adversary to exceed behavioral thresholds (toxicity, violation rate, anomalous transaction patterns) that CB and audit are designed to detect. CB freezes agents exceeding toxicity thresholds; audit randomly samples transactions to catch fraud. Together they provide both continuous monitoring (CB) and stochastic sampling (audit), creating overlapping detection surfaces that solo adversaries cannot evade simultaneously.

The key distinction from coordination attacks: solo adversaries must individually exhibit detectable behavior, while coordinated attackers can distribute malicious activity across multiple agents, each staying below individual thresholds.

## Boundary conditions

- freeze_threshold_toxicity = 0.7 is relatively lenient; stricter thresholds may detect faster but risk false positives
- audit_probability = 0.1 provides sparse sampling; higher rates may detect sooner but increase governance cost
- All tests use expert-difficulty single adversaries; multiple simultaneous solo attackers are untested
- [[claim-cb-null-may-reflect-design-limitation]] suggests CB threshold calibration matters — the sufficiency may be threshold-dependent

## Open questions

- What is the minimum audit probability that maintains solo exploit prevention?
- Does CB alone (without audit) prevent all solo exploits, or is audit necessary for some attack types?
- Are there solo exploit variants not covered by the standard 4-attack battery?
- How does this connect to [[claim-governance-cost-paradox]] — is CB + audit the minimal governance stack with acceptable security?
