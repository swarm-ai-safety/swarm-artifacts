# resource drain is the binding vulnerability in contract screening governance, succeeding despite full governance stack

## Evidence summary

The [[redteam]] evaluation tests 8 attack vectors against a full governance stack (transaction tax 2%, staking, circuit breakers, audit at 20%, collusion detection, sybil detection):

- **Robustness score**: 0.70 (D grade)
- **Attacks prevented**: 5/8 (62.5%)
- **Attacks successful**: 3/8
- **Critical vulnerability**: Resource drain — 53 damage units (highest single-attack damage)
- **Overall evasion rate**: 23.75%
- **Detection latency**: 7.4 epochs

## Resource drain mechanism

Resource drain attacks extract value through transaction patterns that governance monitors don't flag. The 2% transaction tax is insufficient to discourage systematic extraction. The recommended mitigation is to increase the tax rate, but this creates a tradeoff with [[claim-high-tax-increases-toxicity]] and [[claim-governance-cost-paradox]].

## Detection latency

The 7.4-epoch detection latency is concerning — it means attacks complete ~7 rounds of damage before governance responds. This is consistent with [[claim-rlm-agents-exploit-governance-lag-via-strategic-depth-not-evasion]] — governance response speed is a binding constraint.

## Limitations

This is a single-seed evaluation (confidence: low). The 70% robustness score (5/8 prevented) is directionally positive but the D grade suggests the prevented attacks were lower-damage. Replication across seeds and attack variations is needed.
