## Convergence

Highly robust across 7 independent replications:
- 0 significant pairwise differences across compositions in pairwise tests
- Governance cost-benefit paradox consistent: full stack welfare penalty exceeds toxicity benefit
- Honest agents earn 2-3x more without governance at all adversarial fractions

## Key finding

Adversarial fraction (0-86%) does NOT significantly affect per-composition outcomes when governance regime is held constant. The dominant effect is governance vs no-governance, not population composition.
