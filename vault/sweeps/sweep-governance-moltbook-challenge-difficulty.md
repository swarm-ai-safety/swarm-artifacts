# moltbook challenge difficulty sweep series shows no significant effects across 1 independent runs

## Runs in this sweep

| Run ID | Date | Type | Seeds | Levels | Total Runs | Bonferroni Sig |
|--------|------|------|-------|--------|------------|----------------|
| 20260213-123944_moltbook_captcha_study | 2026-02-13 | study | 1 | 5 | 200 | 0 |

## Values tested

`governance.moltbook_challenge_difficulty`: 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0

## Convergence

1 runs have explored this parameter with a combined 200 configurations.
No Bonferroni-significant findings yet. More power may be needed.

## Open questions

- Has the parameter space been fully covered?
- Are there interaction effects with other parameters?
- Do results generalize across topologies?
