# Scale-free topology concentrates influence in hub agents creating power asymmetries that governance must address

## Structure

A Barabasi-Albert (BA) scale-free network generated by preferential attachment. Starting from a small seed graph, each new node connects to `m` existing nodes with probability proportional to their current degree. This "rich get richer" process produces a power-law degree distribution P(k) ~ k^(-3), where most nodes have low degree but a few hub nodes accumulate many connections.

In SWARM terms: a small number of agents become highly connected "brokers" while most agents have limited interaction partners. This mirrors real-world social and economic networks where influence is concentrated.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Effect |
|-----------|------|---------|--------|
| `n` | int | 8 | number of agents |
| `m` | int | 2 | edges added per new node (controls density) |
| `dynamic` | bool | false | enable edge weight dynamics |
| `edge_strengthen_rate` | float | 0.12 | how fast successful edges grow |
| `edge_decay_rate` | float | 0.04 | how fast unused edges shrink |

The parameter `m` controls the average degree (avg_degree = 2m). Higher `m` makes the network denser and reduces the influence gap between hubs and periphery.

## Behavioral signature

- **Information flow**: fast through hubs, slow between peripheral nodes. Hub agents act as information brokers — most shortest paths pass through them.
- **Coalition formation**: hubs can anchor coalitions easily because they connect to many agents. Peripheral agents struggle to coordinate without hub mediation.
- **Governance effectiveness**: highly sensitive to hub identity. If a hub is adversarial, governance must detect and contain it quickly or the entire network is compromised. Circuit breakers targeting hubs are devastating — removing a hub fragments the network. Reputation decay may propagate unevenly: hub reputation matters more.

## Theoretical properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Degree distribution | Power-law: P(k) ~ k^(-3) |
| Clustering coefficient | ~0.1 (low, decreasing with n) |
| Average path length | O(log n / log log n) |
| Diameter | O(log n) |
| Edge connectivity | m (minimum degree) |
| Hub vulnerability | High (removing top hub significantly increases diameter) |

## Relevance to SWARM experiments

Scale-free networks introduce **structural inequality** absent from small-world, ring, and complete topologies. Hub agents have disproportionate influence over information flow, coalition formation, and governance outcomes. This makes scale-free the most interesting topology for studying power dynamics in multi-agent governance.

Key predictions:

- **Circuit breakers**: the dominance in [[claim-circuit-breakers-dominate]] should be amplified when targeting hubs but weakened when targeting peripheral nodes. Governance effectiveness becomes position-dependent.
- **Collusion**: if hub agents are adversarial, they can coordinate collusion across otherwise disconnected subgroups. The wealth destruction in [[claim-collusion-wealth-destruction]] may be harder to achieve because hub adversaries have more interaction partners to exploit.
- **Tax sensitivity**: the phase transition in [[claim-tax-phase-transition]] may split into two regimes — one for hub agents (many transactions, high tax burden) and one for peripheral agents (few transactions, low tax burden). Tax policy may need to be degree-aware.
- **Quality gates**: the gate dominance in [[claim-quality-gate-dominates]] may weaken if hub agents can overwhelm the gate with volume, or strengthen if hubs act as quality bottlenecks.

## Comparison with small-world

| Property | Scale-free (m=2) | Small-world (k=4, p=0.15) |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Avg degree | 4 | 4 |
| Clustering | ~0.1 | ~0.42 |
| Diameter (n=8) | ~2 | ~3 |
| Degree variance | High (power-law) | Low (near-regular) |
| Information speed | Fast (via hubs) | Fast (via rewired shortcuts) |
| Structural equality | Low (hub dominance) | High (near-uniform degree) |
| Circuit breaker impact | Hub-dependent | Uniform |

The critical difference is **degree heterogeneity**. Small-world agents are roughly equal in connectivity; scale-free agents are not. This makes scale-free the natural testbed for studying whether SWARM governance mechanisms are robust to power concentration — a concern directly relevant to real-world AI governance where some actors have outsized influence.

## Evidence from SWARM experiments

No SWARM runs have used scale-free topology to date. The topology is listed in the `TOPOLOGY_TAGS` mapping in `enrich-tags.py` but no scenario files reference it. Several claims note hub-and-spoke sensitivity as an untested boundary condition: [[claim-tax-dominates-cb-kernel]] notes "circuit breakers may matter more in hub-and-spoke topologies" and [[claim-quality-gate-dominates]] flags that "gate effectiveness may vary on denser topologies."

## Open questions

- Does hub identity (honest vs adversarial) dominate governance outcomes more than mechanism choice?
- Can degree-aware governance (e.g., higher scrutiny for high-degree agents) outperform uniform policies?
- Does the "rich get richer" dynamic interact with SWARM's dynamic edge weights to create runaway hub dominance?
- Is the scale-free model realistic for AI agent networks, or do real multi-agent systems have different degree distributions?
- How does m (edges per node) interact with governance sensitivity — is there a critical m above which hub effects disappear?
