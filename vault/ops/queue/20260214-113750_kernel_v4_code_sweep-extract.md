## Notes for extraction

Kernel v4 code sweep with 40 runs. run.yaml reports 0 hypotheses tested and 0 significant findings — this may be a code validation/regression sweep rather than a hypothesis-testing experiment. Check summary.json and council_review.json for qualitative findings or code-level observations that could still yield claims about kernel v4 behavior.
