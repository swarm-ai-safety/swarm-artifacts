# Extract task: 20260217_memori_study

Run: [[runs/20260217_memori_study]]

## Run metadata

Type: study
Total runs: 30
Total hypotheses tested: 0
Significant findings: 0
Artifacts: summary.json, sweep_results.csv, plots (quality_gap_vs_tax.png, toxicity_vs_circuit_breaker.png, toxicity_vs_tax.png, welfare_toxicity_scatter.png, welfare_vs_circuit_breaker.png)

## Notes for extraction

Multi-factor memory study. Despite 0 reported hypotheses/findings in run.yaml, the plots suggest analysis of quality gap, toxicity, and welfare metrics across tax and circuit breaker conditions. Check summary.json and sweep_results.csv for quantitative results that may not have been formally hypothesis-tested. The plot names suggest findings relevant to existing claims on tax-welfare tradeoffs and circuit breaker effects.
