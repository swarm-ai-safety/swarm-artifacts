# Extract task: 20260214-014153_tau_k_calibration

Run: [[runs/20260214-014153_tau_k_calibration]]

## Run metadata

Type: calibration
Seeds: 101, 202, 303, 404, 505
Artifacts: summary.json, recommendation.json, runs.csv

## Notes for extraction

Tau-k hyperparameter calibration across 5 seeds. Check recommendation.json for optimal parameter values. Compare with second calibration run (20260214-020518) — may represent iteration on calibration methodology. Extract recommended tau/k values and their stability across seeds.
