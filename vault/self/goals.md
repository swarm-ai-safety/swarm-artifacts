# goals

## Active Threads

- Ars Contexta initialized — vault/ops/ and vault/self/ created 2026-02-20
- 110+ experiment notes available for synthesis pipeline
- 12 active claims — review for completeness and cross-linking
- 8 failure patterns — validate provenance and cross-link to governance claims
- 7 sweep series — extract parameter sensitivity findings

## Pending Processing

- Run `/extract` on recent experiment runs to add to synthesis queue
- Run `/cross-link` on existing claims without dense connections
- Run `/validate` on claims with incomplete evidence provenance

## Completed

(none yet via Ars Contexta pipeline)
