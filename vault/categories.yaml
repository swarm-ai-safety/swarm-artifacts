extraction_categories:
  - claims                    # testable propositions with evidence
  - evidence                  # statistical results, effect sizes, p-values
  - boundary-conditions       # limits of generalizability
  - governance-effects        # how governance mechanisms change outcomes
  - topology-effects          # how network structure changes outcomes
  - failure-patterns          # named vulnerability and attack patterns
  - contradictions            # results that conflict with existing claims
  - open-questions            # gaps that need investigation
  - phase-transitions         # parameter thresholds where behavior changes qualitatively
  - mechanism-interactions    # synergies and antagonisms between governance levers
  - methodology-notes         # statistical methods, experimental design lessons
